Dependent Variables:
- Average time per session (average over all three participants)
- Average selection accuracy per session (distance from selection point to target) (average over all three
participants)
- Average amount of incorrect selections (average over all three participants) 

- Task Workload using the following single item question :
“On a scale from 1 to 10, how easy was to perform the task” (1 lowest 10 highest)
- Presence using the following single item question:
“On a scale from 1 to 10 how present did you feel in the virtual world” (1 lowest 10 highest)
- Enjoyment using:
“On a scale from 1 to 10, how much fun did you have during the task ” (1 lowest 10 highest)

For the evaluation, the participants are two of my friends and me. One is very familar with VR headset and often plays his own VR. The other just tried sometimes before. After finishing guidance and 2 trainings(each for 10 objects), we took the task.

### User1(Me)
Total time: 72 seconds

Total Errors: 0

(I must say I am really familar with this technique and also the guide arrow. It's really easy for me to finish this task.)

### User2(VR lover)
Total time: 98 seconds

Total Errors: 5


### User3(Not Familar)
Total time: 126 seconds

Total Errors: 7

(He spent more time on the locomtion, rahter than selecting objects. He told me it's a bit dizzying to move in the first person perspective.)


**Task Workload:** The average score was 9 out of 10. Since my technique is similar to raycasting, it's very easy to use.
**Presence**: The average score was 6 out of 10. Not good. One mention that if using hands ranther than controller may be better.
**Enjoyment**: The average score was 7.3 out of 10. Good. They think moving cursor is interesting.
