### Hand Bubble
This technique can generate a bubble on user's hand. Users can control the volume of this bubble.

Alex stood by the shelf for a long time. She wanted to get her hands on that one packet of chips hidden by other flavors. She can use Hand Bubble to get them. First she reaches her hands to the hidden chips then she resizes the bubble to select only one packet.

### Object Menu
Users can use raycast to select a shelf and then generate a menu of this shelf. Users can then select the objects on the menu.

Tailuo wants to buy a lot of things. Why not just give him a menu? He first point one shelf with raycast light. Then he select the object on menu, and the chosen object will then fly towards him.
